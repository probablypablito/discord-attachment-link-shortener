# discord-attachment-link-shortener
 A web page that shortens given cdn.discordapp.com/attachment/.. links to point towards the page and redirects those links to the proper Discord attachment link afterward.
 
 Uses NodeJS. Converts the data in the link from BigInt to Base64 to shorten it, and reverses that to redirect the user to the original file.
